## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid
- React
- Data component to save social media links

### What I learned

I went through the main principles of React to create a component that will be reused in this case, into a grid of buttons.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

```css
.blog-card-content {
  padding: var(--sp-300) 0;
  display: flex;
  flex: 1 0 auto;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: var(--cl-gray-950);
}
```

### Continued development

- Enhance
- Responsive development not based on screen size.

The .blog-card-content element needs a gap: 12px; to add space between the text items.

The main card container needs a border to match the design.
